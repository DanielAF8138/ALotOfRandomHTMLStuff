# center-yourself

## Center an elem horizontally

1. Make a page with only 1 element inside body: main
1. put 1 element only inside main: img
1. use a square image (perhaps from https://picsum.photos or if you're ready for the challenge, add some image of your own/ stolen from the web and test your ability to publish this code to github pages), restricted to 10rem in size
1. without using flexbox or css-grid, write CSS rules to center the image horizontally in the page

## Center an elem vertically
1. Duplicate the directory containing your code for the previous part (we'd like to keep it as a reference/example)
1. update the style rules to also center the img vertically
