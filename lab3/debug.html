    <p>
      This page has a <strong>number of <em>badly formatted</em></strong>
      elements that should be fixed. As you are reading through this code, you
      should consider the following problems:
      
      <ul>
        <li>Are all elements closed that need to be?
        <li>Are elements closed in the reverse order they were opened?
        <li>Are there missing quotation marks?
      </ul>
    
      <p>
      Once you fix all of the problems here, proceed to the
      <a href="debug2.html">next step</a>
